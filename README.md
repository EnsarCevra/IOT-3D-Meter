IoT 3D Space Measurement Device


Overview

This project is an IoT device that uses three ultrasonic sensors to measure distances in all directions in 3D space: width, height, and depth. The device is controlled by a .NET MAUI Blazor mobile application, which allows users to manage the device and read measurements.

Features

Three Ultrasonic Sensors: Measure width, height, and distance.
.NET MAUI Blazor Mobile Application:
Four switches:
Device On/Off
Three individual sensor On/Off switches
Display individual measurements for width, height, and distance
Calculate and display the surface area or volume of the measured space based on the number of active sensors
Hardware Requirements
Three Ultrasonic Sensors
Microcontroller compatible with .NET MAUI Blazor (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino with a network interface)
Power Supply
Software Requirements
.NET MAUI Blazor
Development environment for .NET (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code)
Necessary libraries for interfacing with ultrasonic sensors (e.g., GPIO libraries)
Installation and Setup
Hardware Setup
Connect Ultrasonic Sensors:

Connect each of the three ultrasonic sensors to the microcontroller.
Ensure sensors are positioned to measure width, height, and depth accurately.
Power the Microcontroller:

Connect the microcontroller to a power supply.
Software Setup
Clone the Repository

Open the project in your preferred .NET development environment.
Configure the Application:

Ensure the GPIO pins in the code match the pins to which the sensors are connected.
Modify any necessary configurations in the appsettings.json or relevant configuration files.
Deploy the Application:

Deploy the .NET MAUI Blazor application to your mobile device.
Usage
Start the Device:

Use the mobile application to turn the device on.
Activate Sensors:

Use the individual sensor switches in the application to turn each sensor on or off as needed.
Read Measurements:

The application will display real-time measurements from each active sensor.
You can also view the calculated surface area or volume based on the active sensors.
